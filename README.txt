This is a React js code snippet that experiments with the Marked library.
To use, place whole index.js file into a react project + make sure that index.html has a tag with id=root.
Run, then edit the text in the textarea box - the bottom of the page will display the input parsed from markdown.
Since it has no CSS right now, it may look... bad. But it should *work*.
