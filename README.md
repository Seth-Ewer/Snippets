# Snippets

This repository contains a couple of pieces of code I have written as practice.


### Markdown Parsing
https://github.com/Seth-Ewer/Snippets/blob/main/snippets/src/markdownparsing/MarkdownParsing.js

This is a React project experimenting with the Marked library for markdown parsing.
The core idea is that any markdown syntax entered into the textbox at the top will be rendered in the box at the bottom.
This is done by storing the text in a state variable, then converting it to HTML with Marked.


### Random Quote Machine
https://github.com/Seth-Ewer/Snippets/blob/main/snippets/src/randomquotemachine/RandomQuoteMachine.js

This is a React project that displays random quotes from a list.
